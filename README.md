Testing first Git repository...
Checking out Git from 
VS2013, 
from Git Bash, 
Git Gui, 
GitHub,
Git Schell

well it seam like fun, but real question to find out is it better than TFS?
whan TFS and when Git

TFS supports whole app life cyle managment, Git seams to be only
great way to manage code repositories...

but at least with vs2013 has great integration with vs2013

and larges YES to question why I will use... Microsoft supports it :D


only shit is... you cant with free version of github create private project!
Realy GitHub... ?
